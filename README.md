The aim of this project is to analyse the palmer penguin data sets created by Alison and provide insightful information.
Data set was created by [Alison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/>) using the data collected by **Dr. Kristen Gorman** and **the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER** during the period of 2007 – 2009.
The data set is a collection of different measurements of the three species of penguins (Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap) that live in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica.This project and analysis used body mass as a key parameter and focus on its relationship with other parameters.

## Use of this project

This project is interesting and have different uses for several reasons.
Firstly it focus on the body mass and its combination with other parameters. This approach gives us a clear understanding on how the body mass of the species influence the composition of the colony. 
This repository is interesting for other students that are starting in the world of data analytics. It provides an insightful analysis of the influence of the body mass in the colony. For people that are starting in the data analytic world, it provides simple graphs and code that can be easily reused.

## Ideas for further analysis 

As mentioned, this project used the body mass as a conductor. During the work it was noticed an interesting information if we added the island to the combination. Unfortunately, my skills are not ready yet for this complex analysis. 
Almost half of the population in the colony lives in Biscoe Island. All the population of gentoo penguins (which has the bigger body mass) and part of the Adelie lives there. It would be interesting to see if the Adelie penguins that lives in Biscoe Island are also the ones with the bigger body mass in that specie for example.
