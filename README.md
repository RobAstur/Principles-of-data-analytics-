# Analysis of palmer penguins’ dataset 



![image palmer penguins](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:794/1*-L98msP9fNZaFsW45j84tQ.png)


The aim of this project is to analyse the palmer penguin data sets created by Alison and provide insightful information.
Data set was created by [Alison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/>) using the data collected by **Dr. Kristen Gorman** and **the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER** during the period of 2007 – 2009.
The data set is a collection of different measurements of the three species of penguins (Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap) that live in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. This project and the analysis use the body mass as a key parameter and focus on its relationship with other parameters.

## Use of this project

This project is interesting and have different uses for several reasons.
Firstly, it focusses on the body mass as a key driver. This approach gives us a clear understanding on how the body mass of the penguin’s species influence in the composition of the colony. 
This project is interesting for other students that are starting in the data analytic field. It provides simple code and charts that can be easily replicated. 



## Getting started

In order to work with this repository, the author recommends the installations of below packages/programs.

*	Install the latest version of Python and Pandas, Matplotlib and NumPy modules. All of it include in  [Anaconda ]( https://www.anaconda.com/download/). 
*   To start using the notebooks, I recommend to install [Visual studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). 
*   Don't forget to restart Kernel and run the cells.
*   Don't forget to remove NAN from the data set.

## Ideas for further analysis 

As mentioned, this project used the body mass as a conductor. Although it covers different areas there are still further investigation that could be carried on. For example, le body mass Vs bill length. 
Finally, it would be also interesting to compare size of the penguins and island where they live. That could be an indicator of the availability of food or the presence of predators in the area.
