This aim of this project is to analyse the palmer penguin data sets created by Alison and provide insightful information.
Data set was created by [Alison Horst] (https://allisonhorst.com/>) using the data collected by **Dr. Kristen Gorman** and **the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER** during the period of 2007 – 2009.
The data set is a collection of measurements of the three species of penguins that live in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica (Gentoo, Adelie, and Chinstrap).
